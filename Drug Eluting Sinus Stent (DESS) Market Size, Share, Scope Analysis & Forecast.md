Chronic sinusitis, a condition marked by persistent inflammation of the sinuses, has seen a surge in the adoption of DESS due to its ability to deliver localized medication directly to the affected areas. This localized delivery helps in reducing inflammation and prevents the need for more invasive surgical interventions. As patients seek effective long-term relief from sinusitis symptoms, the demand for DESS has increased. The ultimate goal of using DESS in this application is to improve patient outcomes by enhancing drug delivery efficiency and reducing recurrence rates, thereby addressing a major healthcare concern and offering substantial benefits in terms of patient comfort and recovery.</p><p>Additionally, the market is experiencing growth due to the increasing use of DESS in post-surgical applications. After sinus surgery, the stent’s role in maintaining sinus patency and delivering anti-inflammatory medications is crucial for the healing process. This application is pivotal as it helps prevent the regrowth of nasal polyps and keeps the sinuses open, which can be particularly challenging following surgery. The DESS's ability to provide continuous drug release during the critical healing phase makes it an essential tool in post-surgical sinus care. As healthcare professionals and patients alike recognize the benefits of these stents in maintaining optimal sinus function and reducing the risk of complications, the market for DESS in this application continues to expand, showcasing its vital role in comprehensive sinus care.</p></p><p id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Reseach Report @ <a target="">https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=634322&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=256</a></strong></p><h3 id="" class="">Who is the largest manufacturers of&nbsp;Drug Eluting Sinus Stent (DESS) Market worldwide?</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Intersect ENT</Li><Li>Inc.</Li><Li> Medtronic Plc</Li><Li> Stryker Corporation</Li><Li> Johnsonï¼†Johnson</h3><h3 id="" class="">Drug Eluting Sinus Stent (DESS) Market &nbsp;Segments Analysis</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation strategy, the Drug Eluting Sinus Stent (DESS) Market research report provides an in-depth analysis of numerous market segments, including application, type, and location.
